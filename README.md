# Monte Carlo Simulation: Stock Price Paths

This project uses a Monte Carlo method to simulate future stock price paths using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**.  
It's a foundational technique in quantitative finance used for pricing, forecasting, and risk analysis.

## üß† Key Learnings

- How to model stock prices using stochastic processes
- Use of random number generation to simulate uncertainty
- Understanding the importance of drift and volatility in price evolution
- Visualising future outcomes and uncertainty bands

---

## üìà Output

The plot below shows the results of a Monte Carlo simulation of 1,000 potential stock price paths over a one-year horizon (252 trading days), starting from an initial price of $100.

![Simulated Paths](simulation_plot.png)

Each line represents one possible future path of the stock, based on a Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) process. This model assumes:

- A constant expected return (`Œº`)
- A constant volatility (`œÉ`)
- Random shocks generated from a standard normal distribution

### üîç Interpretation

- The lines **fan out** over time, showing increasing uncertainty the further into the future you go.
- Some paths end significantly above the initial price, while others dip far below ‚Äî demonstrating the **range of possible outcomes** in a probabilistic market.
- This visualisation is useful in:
  - **Option pricing** (e.g., Monte Carlo for path-dependent options)
  - **Risk modelling** (e.g., estimating the likelihood of extreme drops)
  - **Scenario analysis** (e.g., stress testing)

At the end of the notebook, we calculate the **expected final price** and the **standard deviation** across all simulated outcomes, giving a quick snapshot of potential risk and reward.
